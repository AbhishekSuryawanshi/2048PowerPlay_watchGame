Welcome to 2048 PowerPlay, a dynamic version of the classic 2048 game, built for Apple Watch using SwiftUI. This project is a part of my learning and exploration in mobile game development, specifically for the Apple Watch interface. The game features a compact 3x3 grid, intuitive swipe gestures, and support for the Digital Crown.

ðŸŽ® Game Features

	â€¢	Compact 3x3 Grid: Optimized for Apple Watch screens.
	â€¢	Swipe Gestures: Move the tiles by swiping in four directions.
	â€¢	Digital Crown Integration: Use the crown for vertical movements (up and down).
	â€¢	Power-Ups: Special tiles to clear rows, columns, or double your tileâ€™s value.
	â€¢	Dynamic Scoring: Tracks the current score and best score.

ðŸ›  Built With

	â€¢	SwiftUI: The user interface is built with Appleâ€™s declarative SwiftUI framework.
	â€¢	WatchOS: The game is designed to run on Apple Watch, using watchOS-specific features like the Digital Crown.
